# Practice Programming

Every day I will do a small 30ish minute programming practice session. These are meant to be
thrown away when I am done and just to work on skills that help me when programming in the
large. Use of libraries or prebuilt scaffolding are permitted so I can focus on specific problems rather than boilerplate.

## Skills I wish to get better at.
  * System level programming in c.
  * Multithreaded programming
  * Graphics programming.
  * Algorithms and data structures.
  * Implementing things from papers.
  * Simulation code, physics stuff.
  * Data viz.
  * Maybe some audo stuff.
