# Practice Programming

Every day I will do a small 30ish minute programming practice session. These are meant to be
thrown away when I am done and just to work on skills that help me when programming in the
large. Use of libraries or prebuilt scaffolding are permitted so I can focus on specific problems rather than boilerplate.

## Skills I wish to get better at.
  * System level programming in c.
  * Multithreaded programming
  * Graphics programming.
  * Algorithms and data structures.
  * Implementing things from papers.
  * Simulation code, physics stuff.
  * Data viz.
  * Maybe some audo stuff.

* #####2015-01-04: Threaded Work Queue.
    
    **Problem**: Build a multithreaded circular work queue using processor atomics.

    **Time**: 37 minutes
    
    I managed to get a little linear single producer multiple consumer work queue up and
    running in half an hour. I didn't get to making it a ring buffer. It could be cool to
    try and build on this to implement different concurrency patterns but I don't know if
    that is against the rules or not. I feel like 30 minutes isn't much time and it takes
    about 30 mins to type out all the boilerplate to do this. We'll see though, maybe it's
    just because I'm rusty. Felt overall like a good first day.
