This is practice.

Every day I will do a small 30ish minute programming practice session. These are meant to be
thrown away when I am done and just to work on skills that help me when programming in the
large.
I think the use of libraries is definately permitted, especially when I want to work on precedural generation things or graphics things I can totally use some already built scaffolding to set up the scene. For other things like linux system stuff or concurrent data structures and stuff it's probably best if I do them from scratch. I am completely aloud and encouraged to do the same problem multiple days because practicing is how you get better at something. Maybe I'll get really crazy and have a practice problem gemerator in some domain so I can practice multiple similar problems and get better at those.

All 

# Skills I wish to get better at.

* System level programming in c.
* Multithreaded programming
* Graphics programming techniques.
* Algorithms and data structures.
* Implementing things from papers.
* Simulation code, physics stuff.
* Data viz.
